# Portfolio Website Structure & Presentation Plan

This plan outlines how to showcase the analytics projects in a web portfolio.

## Organize by Domain or Skill
- Create a navigation menu with clear categories such as Operations, Marketing, Healthcare, and Finance.
- Alternatively, group projects by technique (e.g., Machine Learning, SQL) if that better reflects the work.
- Each category links to its project page, showcasing multi-domain expertise.

## Project Pages with Detail
- Start with a brief overview summarizing the problem, data, and outcome.
- Follow with sections for **Data Pipeline**, **Methods**, **Results**, and **Insights** using headings and bullet points.
- Embed or link to visuals such as pipeline diagrams, data snapshots, charts, or interactive dashboards to keep readers engaged.

## Highlight Code (Python & SQL)
- Show relevant Python and SQL snippets using well-formatted, commented code blocks or embedded GitHub gists.
- Briefly explain what each snippet accomplishes to emphasize hands-on ability.

## Technical Stack for the Site
- Host the site with GitHub Pages or another static host.
- Author content in Markdown or Jupyter notebooks that are converted to HTML for static hosting.
- Optionally use a static site generator such as Jekyll or Hugo, or build a simple HTML/CSS site for full control.

## Additional Sections
- Add an **About Me** page highlighting skills (Python, SQL, visualization) and domain interests.
- Include a **Skills/Tools** page listing libraries, databases, and concepts.
- Optional pages: a blog, FAQ, or news/update log to demonstrate ongoing learning and communication ability.

## Polish and Professionalism
- Keep the design clean with concise headings, short paragraphs, and bullet points.
- Use icons or logos for tools where appropriate, keeping them subtle and professional.
- Conclude each project page with a takeaway that ties technical work to real-world impact.
