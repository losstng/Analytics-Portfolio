## Executive Summary
Design a flagship operations analytics project: an end‑to‑end Synthetic Supply Chain Digital Twin for a mid‑size omni‑channel manufacturer—integrating demand forecasting, inventory & multi‑echelon replenishment, warehouse 3D slotting optimization, order fulfillment process mining, and prescriptive capacity & routing decisions. Built purely in Python notebooks with richly generated multi‑granular synthetic + 3D spatial data. Showcases depth (forecasting, optimization, simulation, causal, process mining) within 2 intensive weeks. Delivers executive value narrative: reduce stockouts (est. −35%), inventory holding (est. −18%), pick path distance (est. −22%), and order cycle time (est. −28%). Differentiates vs “vanilla demand forecast” by combining spatial 3D warehouse modeling + process mining + solver optimization + simulation alignment into a coherent decision stack.

## Portfolio Positioning Rationale
- Bridges marketing analytics pedigree (MMM, LTV, causal) to operations efficiency—demonstrating transfer of rigorous experimental & modeling discipline.
- Targets Data / Operations Analytics Intern roles—evidence of business-minded optimization & practical decision enablement.
- High sophistication with only Python: proves resourcefulness (synthetic data engineering, reproducible pipeline, layered analytics).
- 3D spatial digital twin lifts differentiation and storytelling (visual warehouse cube showing congestion & slotting changes).
- Emphasizes intern‑relevant adaptability: fast 2‑week high‑impact build, modular extensibility.

## Recommended Concept (with justification)
Selected: 3D Warehouse Slotting & Pick Path Optimization Digital Twin (Option 2).

Clear HR translation (reduced cycle time & labor cost). Distinctive vs typical academic projects.

## Detailed Project Blueprint
Objective: Reduce order picking travel & congestion through data-driven re‑slotting and route optimization using a synthetic 3D warehouse digital twin.  
Scope: One warehouse (10k m², 4 vertical levels, 3 zones: fast, medium, bulk). Include 1,500 SKUs, 26 weeks historical order lines, future 4-week scenario.  
Out of Scope: Real hardware integration, WMS live API, labor contract nuances.  
Stakeholders (hypothetical): Ops Manager, Warehouse Supervisor, Supply Chain Analyst, Finance Controller.  
Assumptions: Travel time ~ Manhattan distance + vertical penalty; pickers batch 5 orders; equipment homogeneous; SKU velocity stable within ±20% weekly noise.  
Success Definition: ≥20% reduction in average pick path distance & ≥10% improvement lines/hour while maintaining 98% line accuracy.  
Decisions Informed: Slotting assignments, zone definitions, batch sizing, routing heuristic choice.  
Analytical Layers:  
- Descriptive: Velocity distribution, heatmaps of congestion.  
- Diagnostic: Correlate path inflation with slot dispersion & co-pick affinity.  
- Predictive: Forecast SKU weekly demand/velocity (lightweight) to anticipate re-slot.  
- Prescriptive: Optimization (slot assignment + routing) & simulation for validation.  
Phase Objectives (See Timeline): Data Gen → Baseline Analysis → Modeling/Optimization → Simulation Validation → Story Packaging.

## Data Strategy & Feature Engineering Plan
Synthetic Data Sources/Generation:  
- SKU Master (id, category, cube, weight) – Python faker + controlled distributions.  
- Order Lines (timestamp, order_id, sku, qty) – Nonhomogeneous Poisson (diurnal + weekday seasonality).  
- Location Grid (x,y,z, zone, capacity) – Programmatic 3D lattice.  
- Historical Slot Map (sku→location) – Random with mild popularity bias (imperfect baseline).  
- Travel Graph – Derived from adjacency of aisles (NetworkX).  
- Picker Event Log – Simulation of baseline operations (SimPy).  
- Affinity Matrix – Derived from order line co-occurrence.  
URLs: Document generation code; optionally incorporate open SKU categories (e.g., https://data.world) for names.  
Feature Engineering (≥12):  
- Temporal: Hour-of-day order arrival rate; Weekday flag; Peak window indicator.  
- Velocity Metrics: Lines/week, Units/week, 4-week moving average, velocity rank percentile.  
- Co-Pick Affinity: Lift (P(A,B)/(P(A)P(B))).  
- Spatial: Distance to dock; Z-level; Aisle congestion score (orders/hour / aisle width).  
- Ratios: Cube utilization (SKU volume / location capacity), Weight density.  
- Lag/Lrolling: 4-week velocity volatility (std/mean), Rolling pick time per batch.  
- Segmentation: ABC class (Pareto), Fragility class.  
- Anomaly Flags: Sudden velocity spike (>3σ), Out-of-zone placement flag (fast SKU not in fast zone).  
- Cost Drivers: Estimated labor seconds per pick (base + vertical + congestion penalty).  
- Routing Features: Average nearest-neighbor distance within batch, Clarke-Wright saving approximations.  
All stored as parquet; feature registry (YAML + Python dictionary).

## Modeling & Analytical Methods
Tasks:  
- Velocity Forecasting: LightGBM vs simple exponential smoothing; choose LightGBM if improvement in MAPE >2 pts.  
- Slotting Optimization: MILP or heuristic (two-stage): (1) Cluster SKUs by affinity + velocity (spectral or Louvain on affinity graph). (2) Assign clusters to contiguous locations minimizing sum(distance_to_dock * weighted_velocity) + cross-cluster adjacency penalty.  
- Route Optimization: OR-Tools for TSP variant with batching; fallback nearest-neighbor heuristic for speed.  
- Congestion Modeling: Discrete-event simulation (SimPy) injecting stochastic pick times.  
- Causal Impact: Pre/post re-slot difference-in-differences on pick time controlling for batch size & order complexity.  
- 3D Visualization: Plotly mesh for racks, scatter for SKUs, animation frames pre/post.  
Selection Rationale: Balance interpretability (cluster + linear costs) and performance (OR-Tools). Avoid overkill deep RL given time constraints; include extension path.

## Experiment / Validation Design
Evaluation Metrics:  
- Forecast: MAPE, Weighted MAPE (velocity-weighted).  
- Optimization: Objective cost (distance weighted by velocity), % improvement vs baseline.  
- Simulation: Average & P95 pick path distance, Lines per Labor Hour, Congestion Index (avg queue length at aisle entry).  
- Causal: Difference-in-differences estimate with robust SE; significance p<0.05.  
Backtesting: Rolling origin 8-week window for forecasts.  
Validation: Split SKUs into holdout segments (top 10% velocity vs tail).  
A/B Style: Simulated control (baseline slot map) vs treatment (optimized) across identical generated 1-week demand seeds (multiple random seeds n=10).  
Success Thresholds: ≥20% distance reduction & no >2% increase in congestion variance; maintain fill accuracy proxy (correct line picks).
