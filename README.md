# Analytics-Portfolio

This repository contains my personal collection of analytics projects, notebooks, and data.

## Contents

- **Notebooks** – Example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis and modeling steps.
  - `Master.ipynb` and `Showcase.ipynb` include exploration, model training, and evaluation routines.
- **Scripts** – Utility Python scripts.
  - `intradaydata.py` downloads intraday stock data using the `yfinance` library and stores it under `raw_data/intraday/`.
- **raw_data** – Sample datasets of daily and intraday stock prices used for experimentation.
- **SQL** – A set of SQL queries targeting the Classic Models database for practice with selection and aggregation.
- **python.py** – A single script with many machine learning snippets including model fitting, evaluation metrics, and visualization.
- **Do Hoang Hai Long - Provisional Transcript - 20030239 - 5.pdf** – Example academic transcript included for completeness.

Run the notebooks with Jupyter or execute the scripts directly to reproduce the analyses.
